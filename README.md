# poc-dev-agents

## Overview

This is a proof of concept for a collection of agents that interact with each other to reach a goal defined by the user, as of now the agents only support the use of ollama and local models.

## Run

```shell
go run . --config sample.config.yaml

The project should be runnable locally using a simple Makefile."
